Description: CellML API for PMR2
        ===================
        
        This module provides the CellML API as a utility within a Zope instance.
        It also provides a few helper methods that serve as a more Pythonic
        wrapper around the C oriented nature of the API, and helper methods that
        are in use by PMR2 itself.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1 - Released (2011-04-08)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Released without any usage of the CellML API Python bindings due to
        lack of formalized installation process for the bindings at that time,
        but done so anyway to preserve usage of the method calls to here by
        PMR2.
